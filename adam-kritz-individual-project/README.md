# Adam Kritz Folder

Welcome to my folder. In my individual report folder I have my individual report.

I have the IMDb logo in here to use for the GUI, so don't remove that.

In my code folder, I have 5 files. The "adamCodeTotalDOESNOTRUN.py" has all my code for this project in it, so if you just want to know how much I wrote, you can look there. As the title says, it won't run. The other 4 files should run by themselves, but you will need to make some changes to them if you want to run them (like file locations). I recommend just using the main.py, and there you will see the results of my work (primarily the GUI).
